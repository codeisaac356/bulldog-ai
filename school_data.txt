MESSAGES AND PHONES
To avoid unnecessary classroom disruptions, we are unable to deliver messages to students except in cases of extreme emergencies. The nature of all such emergencies must be established prior to the message delivery. In addition, to decrease classroom interruptions, flowers, balloons, etc. will not be accepted for delivery to students. All such items will be refused delivery at the front office.
